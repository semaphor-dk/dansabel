# dansabel

Dansabel is a suite of static analysis tools for pre-flight checking of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) projects.

The aim is to provide an extendable complement to [Ansible-Lint](https://ansible-lint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), not a replacement.

- [2022-02-25 - **Blog article about Dansabel with screenshots and examples**](https://blog.semaphor.dk/20220225T1408)

It currently consists of:
- a Python script that will use the YAML parser ([ruamel](https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/) as used in Ansible) to parse your YAML files
- a simplistic [Jinja2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja_(template_engine)) linter using the built-in Jinja2 lexer/parser to attempt to detect typos and errors
- a git [pre-commit hook](https://githooks.com/) to launch the other scripts on patches staged for commit to your git repository

The name *dansabel* is the Danish translation of "danceable" - it helps detect when your Ansible playbooks are about to be played out of tune.

Dansabel is written and published by [Semaphor](https://www.semaphor.dk). Founded in 1992 it is a Danish software consultancy and hosting provider that aims to support an open, free, and decentralized internet through its participation in the FOSS communities and using FOSS software to the benefit of our customers. When not faced with global pandemics you can meet us at [BornHack](https://bornhack.dk), CCC, and other community camps, but for the time being we'll have to make do with [email](mailto:info@semaphor.dk) and Jitsi calls. In any case, feel free to contact us.

## Linter

```
 python3 jinjalint.py -h
usage: jinjalint.py [-h] [-C CONTEXT_LINES] [-q] [-v] [-e] [-t] FILE [FILE ...]

Lints each of the provided FILE(s) for jinja2/yaml errors.

positional arguments:
  FILE

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -C CONTEXT_LINES, --context-lines CONTEXT_LINES
                        Number of context lines controls LAST_THRESHOLD
  -q, --quiet           No normal output to stdout
  -v, --verbose         Print verbose output. -v prints all Jinja snippets, regardless of errors. -vv prints full AST for each Jinja
                        node.

Analysis options:
  Dumps a JSON dictionary with the results of various analysis steps.
  Note that these only work for files that can be parsed without errors.
  Use -q to print ONLY this JSON summary.

  -e, --external        List external variables used.
  -t, --tags            List encountered tags.

EXAMPLES

  List external variables used from Jinja:
  jinjalint.py -q --external ./*.j2 ./*.yml

  List tags encountered in YAML files:
  jinjalint.py -q --tags testcases/good/*.yml

  Set environment variable NO_COLOR to disable colored output.
```

### Colors

`jinjalint.py` will try to detect if it's running in a `pty`, and will emit vt100 colors unless [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org/) is set in that case.

### Listing external variable references

```bash
python3 jinjalint.py -q --external testcases/good/*{/*,}.{j2,yml}
```

<details>

```json
{
  "external_variables": {
    "testcases/good/templates/if-elif-endif.j2": [
      "also_good",
      "good"
    ],
    "testcases/good/templates/if-endif.j2": [
      "good"
    ],
    "testcases/good/alias.yml": [
      "hello"
    ],
    "testcases/good/file-with_items-11.yml": [
      "item"
    ],
    "testcases/good/is-not.yml": [
      "i",
      "idict"
    ],
    "testcases/good/simple-expansions.yml": [
      "ok",
      "x"
    ],
    "testcases/good/tags.yml": [
      "ext"
    ]
  }
}
```

In your own project you might run something along the lines of:
```bash
find . -type f '(' -name '*.j2' -or -name '*.yml' -or -path '*/templates/*' ')' \
  -exec ~/dansabel/jinjalint.py -qe {} +
```

</details>

### Listing tags used in YAML files

```bash
python3 jinjalint.py -q --tags testcases/good/*.yml
```

Produces two JSON keys, `files_to_tags` and `tags_to_files`, which map filenames to the tags mentioned in the files and vice-versa.

<details>

```json
{
  "files_to_tags": {
    "testcases/good/tags_strings.yml": [
      "configuration",
      "packages",
      "without quotes"
    ],
    "testcases/good/tags.yml": [
      "configuration",
      "packages"
    ]
  },
  "tags_to_files": {
    "packages": [
      "testcases/good/tags.yml",
      "testcases/good/tags_strings.yml"
    ],
    "without quotes": [
      "testcases/good/tags_strings.yml"
    ],
    "configuration": [
      "testcases/good/tags.yml",
      "testcases/good/tags_strings.yml"
    ]
  }
}
```

</details>

## Git hook

The `pre-commit.sh` script can be used a `pre-commit` git hook.

This hook will run on every invocation of `git commit`, and will block the commit operation if it finds a problem and returns a non-zero exit code.
In case of false positives this behaviour can be bypassed using:
```shell
git commit --no-verify
```

The script will match the extensions of modified files and call out various other tools:
- The `jq` tool to verify that JSON files are syntactically valid (`.json`)
- The `shellcheck` tool to lint shellscripts (`.sh`)
- The `ansible-lint` tool to lint YAML files (`.yml`)
- The linter script contained in this repository to validate YAML files (`.yml`) and Jinja templates (contained in the YAML files or inside `templates/` directories, as used by Ansible).

### pre-commit.com

The project exposes a hook for use with the [pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com/) framework:
- `dansabel`: Parse/lint YAML files and Jinja2 templates (`*.yml`, `*.j2`, `/templates/*`)

## Installation

#### Installation: [https://pre-commit.com](pre-commit.com)

An example of a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for your project (replace `REPLACEME` with this commit id or `HEAD`):
```yaml
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/semaphor-dk/dansabel
  rev: REPLACEME
  hooks:
  - id: dansabel
```

#### Installation: OS deps/no virtualenv

A number of prerequisites are needed:
```shell
sudo apt install jq shellcheck ansible-lint
pip install https://github.com/semaphor-dk/dansabel
```

#### Installation: Git config
You can either install it on a per-repository basis by making a symlink from `.git/hooks/pre-commit` to `pre-commit.sh` in this directory, or as a global hook across all your git repositories.

To configure a hook for a given repository:
```shell
ln -s $(pwd)/pre-commit.sh /path/to/repo/.git/hooks/pre-commit
```

To configure a global hook you can add an entry like this to your `~/.gitconfig` file:
```
[core]
    hooksPath = ~/path/to/dansabel-repo/
```
